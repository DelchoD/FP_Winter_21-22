   #|The idea of the above functon is follow: If the length of the list with all trips
is 1 and there are two equal elememts in both ends we throw error because this is the only conbination
and it is obviously that is cannot happen. If not we start iterating the list of trips where the trips
are sorted by their length and we check if an element of the trips after it was sorted and any repetative 'airports' are deleted
equals with the the same element only with deletion of the repetative elements, if that is true we return the element. As for me this function should
work but somehow when I try to make a recursion in the lambda function it does not happen as i want|#
